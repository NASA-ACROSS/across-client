The `across-client` is the NASA-ACROSS library used to access and manipulate the [`across-server`](https://github.com/ACROSS-Team/across-server) data. What separates this package from the autogenerated sdk is that it also levarages the [`across-tools`](https://github.com/ACROSS-Team/across-tools) package to give users a single interface for their cross-observatory science needs.

# Access

To access our observatory data (telescopes, instruments, schedues, etc) on the [`across-server`](https://github.com/ACROSS-Team/across-server), users do not require any authentication. But if an observatory user-group wants to use the API to publish their planned/completed observing schedules they are required to register, and obtain client credentials through the website.

# Installation

This repository can be installed on python (`version >=3.10`) environments.

```sh
#activate your python environment (conda, mamba, venv... etc)
git clone https://github.com/ACROSS-Team/across-client.git
cd across-client
python -m pip install .
```

# Usage

Below is a small example on how to utilize the client to access JWST Nircam performed observations. For more examples on how to access observatory science data or use our observatory tools endpoints, please go to our [examples](https://github.com/ACROSS-Team/across-client/tree/main/examples) folder.

```python
from datetime import datetime
from across.client import Client

# client credentials are only required for publishing schedules
ACROSS_SERVER_ID: str = "..."
ACROSS_SERVER_SECRET: str = "..."

client = Client(client_id=ACROSS_SERVER_ID, client_secret=ACROSS_SERVER_SECRET)

nircam = client.instrument.get_many(name="nircam")[0]

nircam_observations = client.observations.get_many(
   instrument_ids=[nircam.id],
   status="performed", 
   date_range_begin=datetime(...),
   date_range_end=datetime(...),
)
 ```
